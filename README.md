# Easy Brackets

Replace brackets in a text selection by typing the closing bracket. For example, `("foo")` becomes `{"foo"}` on typing `}` when the text is selected.

To insert a bracket, use the opening bracket instead.

To replace quotes, use the quote instead. Quotes are mostly symmetrical, e.g. <code>"'`</code>, so it doesn't matter which one you use.
